# Project: Testosterone effect on Risk-Taking and Endowment

Accompanying code for the preprint ["A Bayesian Modelling Approach to Examine the Role of Testosterone Administration on the Endowment Effect and Risk-Taking"](https://psyarxiv.com/c37e4) 

We investigate the role of testosterone on risk-taking and loss aversion under positive and negative framing. First, we examine whether testosterone administration affects decision-making in a series of gambles under positive and negative framing (gain and loss) associated with various probabilities. Under testosterone administration, we expect participants to show increased risk-seeking behaviours regardless of framing type. 
Second, we investigate testosterone’s effect on loss aversion (endowment effect) during the economic valuation of two goods categories (utilitarian vs hedonic).
