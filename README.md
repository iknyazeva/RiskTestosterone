# Effects of Testosterone Administration on Endowment Effect and Risk-Taking under Positive and Negative Framing

Accompanying code for the preprint "Effects of Testosterone Administration on Endowment Effect and Risk-Taking under Positive and Negative Framing"

We investigate the role of testosterone on risk-taking and loss aversion under positive and negative framing. First, we examine whether testosterone administration affects decision-making in a series of gambles under positive and negative framing (gain and loss) associated with various probabilities. Under testosterone administration, we expect participants to show increased risk-seeking behaviours regardless of framing type. 
Second, we investigate testosteroneâ€™s effect on loss aversion (endowment effect) during the economic valuation of two goods categories (utilitarian vs hedonic).
